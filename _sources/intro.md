### Accessibility statement

This accessibility statement applies to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Statistical Methods Library (SML) user documentaion website. Please note that this does not include content that is referenced from this guidance.

The website is managed by the Statistical Methods Library at the Office for National Statistics.
We would like this guidance to be accessible for as many people as possible.
This means that you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

For keyboard navigation, {kbd}`Up Arrow` and {kbd}`Down Arrow`keys can be used to scroll up and down on the current page.
{kbd}`Left Arrow` and {kbd}`Right Arrow` keys can be used to move forwards and backwards through the pages of the book.
Tabbed content (including code example) can be focused using the {kbd}`Tab` key.
{kbd}`Left Arrow` and {kbd}`Right Arrow` keys are then used to focus the required tab option,
where {kbd}`Enter` can be used to select that option and display the associated content.

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of our guidance.
If you find any problems not listed on this page or think that we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, please contact us by emailing [SMLHelp@ons.gov.uk](mailto:SMLHelp@ons.gov.uk).
Please also get in touch if you are unable to access any part of this guidance, or require the content in a different format.
